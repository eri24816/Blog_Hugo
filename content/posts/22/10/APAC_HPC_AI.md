I just finish the 2022 APAC HPC AI competition. It took me 7 months from the bigining training to the final presentation. 

Let me review what I got participanting in the competition:

- The confidence speking English.

    During the presentation, I feel that I spoke English much more fluently than before. I could also understand all that the judges said and have a clear conversation with them. 
    
    My past experiences of speaking English were bad. The most occasion I was required to speak English in is the interviews. I had to express myself in English, but most of the time I just stuck there and struggle with how I could turn my thought into words, and lost the opotunities. I had participate in UN simulation
    When I was preparing for the presentation, I writed down most the speech I planned to say in advance to avoid that I would stuck during the presentation and it would be akward.
